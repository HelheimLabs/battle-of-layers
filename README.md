# Battle of layers

On chain game based between competition between EVM layers

# Game world view

A huge exploitable treasure is discovered on Sepolia, and all the different EVM layers want a piece of it. With each layer forming an alliance, expanding the army, and expeditions to Sepolia through CCIP. The treasure can only be excavated by continuously occupying the treasure sites in Sepolia, then war starts....

# Game process

1. Players choose the layer they support, pay Native tokens on chain to add more soldiers, and the number of additional soldiers is equal to the equivalent amount of USD
2. The recruited troops would need CCIP transmissions to reach Sepolia, which could take quite some time
3. Once the army reaches Sepolia, it will be fought to the death. The surviving army will be attacked by any other layers, and only constant reinforcements will be able to hold its ground.

# More thoughts

When we consider on chain game and autonomous world, we cannot avoid that the presence of too many layers reduces composability. Different layers have different characteristics and may be suitable for different regions in the game, in which case different regions may unite into a single unit and 'attack' other layer. I haven't figured out to what extent this will happen, but I can make a demo to show the war between the different chains, then this repo appear.
